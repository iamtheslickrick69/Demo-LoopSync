    question: "How does LoopSync protect employee anonymity?",
    answer:
      "LoopSync uses end-to-end encryption and a zero-knowledge architecture. Messages are processed by AI without ever linking to employee identities. Even LoopSync staff cannot see who sent what. We aggregate insights at minimum group sizes to prevent identification through deduction.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if employees abuse the anonymous system?",
    answer:
      "Our AI is trained to identify and filter abusive content while maintaining anonymity. Pattern detection can identify coordinated misuse. We also provide guidelines to employees and have moderation tools for edge cases.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from regular employee surveys?",
    answer:
      "Traditional surveys are periodic, cumbersome, and often ignored. LoopSync provides always-on, conversational feedback via SMS with 98% engagement rates. You get real-time insights instead of quarterly reports.",
  },
  {
    question: "What size companies benefit most from LoopSync?",
    answer:
      "LoopSync works for organizations from 50 to 50,000+ employees. The ROI is especially strong for companies with distributed workforces, frontline workers, or multiple locations where traditional communication channels fail.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does implementation take?",
    answer:
      "Most companies are up and running within 2 weeks. We handle SMS setup, integrate with your HRIS, and train your team. No IT resources required beyond initial data sync.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can managers retaliate against employees?",
    answer:
      "No. Managers never see individual feedback or identities. They only see aggregated insights at the team level (minimum 5 respondents). Our system is designed to make retaliation impossible.",
  },
